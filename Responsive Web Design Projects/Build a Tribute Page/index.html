Zourab is now searching for a good martial artist to fight in his club. Yuri wants to help Alma pay her debt. Yuri make a deal with Zourab that he will fight for him, exchange for Alma's freedom. Zourab agrees and suggests Yuri to fight in three matches.

Yuri is about to leave, but Zourab forces Yuri to fight one more match to defeat his true champion, Yuri reluctantly agrees. Zourab bribes a high-ranking police officer to bring Koshmar to his club. Koshmar is a giant, furious and relentless martial artist. Zourab thinks Yuri cannot defeat Koshmar.
